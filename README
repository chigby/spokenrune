Howto:

1. Install

gem_home .
bundle install (if bundler is not installed, install it "globally" with "gem_home - ; gem install bundler")
If there are errors, remove Gemfile.lock, it was possibly created with another version of bundler an that is causing problems.

2. Run

nanoc compile && nanoc view

3. Deploy

aws s3 sync --acl public-read --sse --delete output s3://www.spokenrune.com
