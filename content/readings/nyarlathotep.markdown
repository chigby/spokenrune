   Nyarlathotep . . . the crawling chaos . . . I am the last . . . I will tell the audient void. . . .
   I do not recall distinctly when it began, but it was months ago. The general tension was horrible. To a season of political and social upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger; a danger widespread and all-embracing, such a danger as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night.
