  Damn it all! all this our South stinks peace.
  You whoreson dog, Papiols, come! Let's to music!
  I have no life save when the swords clash.

_Sestina Altaforte_.  Ezra Pound.  1909.

LOQUITUR: En Bertrans de Born. Dante Alighieri put this man in hell for that he was a stirrer up of strife. Eccovi! Judge ye! Have I dug him up again? The scene is at his castle, Altaforte. "Papiols" is his jongleur. "The Leopard," the device of Richard Coeur de Lion.
