_Modern Social Media Etiquette_.  Cameron Higby-Naquin.  2013.

Ahh, "modern social media etiquette," that writhing morass of worms,
that tempest on the palm of a fortune-teller's cat, that shower of
charged particles released when a cosmic ray strikes the atmosphere,
that colloquium of firefighters standing around a week-old cigar butt,
that molten crater filled to the brim with lava in the backyard of a
hermit, that dream within a dream, that kelp forest of stingrays and
barracuda through which we must all swim before entering paradise,
that orchestra whose symphonies are composed of ten thousand notes
from ten thousand composers' wastebaskets, that first party after
Babel shattered humanity's tongue and everyone was drunk on horrible
red wine, that book in the shape of a twenty-sided die whose facets
each contain more text than the complete works of St. Augustine, that
land where everything is perfect and also nothing is perfect.
