_Lyonesse_.  Alan Seeger.  1916.

IN LYONESSE was beauty enough, men say:
Long Summer loaded the orchards to excess,
And fertile lowlands lengthening far away,
                                          In Lyonesse.

Came a term to that land's old favoredness:
Past the sea-walls, crumbled in thundering spray,
Rolled the green waves, ravening, merciless.

Through bearded boughs immobile in cool decay,
Where sea-bloom covers corroding palaces,
The mermaid glides with a curious glance to-day,
                                          In Lyonesse.
